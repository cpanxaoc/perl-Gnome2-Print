B<DEPRECATED> Perl bindings to the 2.2 series of the Gnome Print libraries,
for use with gtk2-perl.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE>

This module has been deprecated by the Gtk-Perl project.  This means that the
module will no longer be updated with security patches, bug fixes, or when
changes are made in the Perl ABI.  The Git repo for this module has been
archived (made read-only), it will no longer possible to submit new commits to
it.  You are more than welcome to ask about this module on the Gtk-Perl
mailing list, but our priorities going forward will be maintaining Gtk-Perl
modules that are supported and maintained upstream; this module is neither.

Since this module is licensed under the LGPL v2.1, you may also fork this
module, if you wish, but you will need to use a different name for it on CPAN,
and the Gtk-Perl team requests that you use your own resources (mailing list,
Git repos, bug trackers, etc.) to maintain your fork going forward.

This module allows you to use the GNOME Print libraries within your
applications written using the gtk2-perl wrapper.  The GNOME Print libraries
(also known as libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui) allow you to create
printable documents (using various frontends) and offer standard widgets in
order to mainatin a UI consistent for all GNOME applications.
