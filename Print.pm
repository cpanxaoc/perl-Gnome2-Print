=head1 NAME

Gnome2::Print - Perl wrappers for the Gnome Print utilities.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Gtk2;
  Gtk2->init;
  my $window = Gtk2::Window->new ('toplevel');
  my $button = Gtk2::Button->new ('Quit');
  $button->signal_connect (clicked => sub { Gtk2->main_quit });
  $window->add ($button);
  $window->show_all;
  Gtk2->main;

=head1 ABSTRACT

  Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set.
  This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a perlish
  and object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory 
  management in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Gnome2 module allows a perl developer to use the Gnome libraries.
Find out more about Gnome+ at http://www.gnome.org.

To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors,
join gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

If you have a web site set up for your module, mention it here.

FIXME we have no other documentation, but we probably need it.
